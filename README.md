# WIP!

# <div align="center">ExiledGamemodeSystem<br><sub>This repo serves both as a dependency and plugin for server owners</sub></div>

This is a pretty simple dependency for developers to create events and gamemodes.

There is a Plugin provided to help with understanding how the dependacy works, The plugin also serves as a public plugin with events/gamemodes for server owners to use. 

### Users are free to suggest gamemodes to be added to the plugin, Please open a github issue. Just remember that I am busy and have a life, So I may not add your suggestion.
### Developers are free to add their own events/gamemodes to the plugin here. You can also make suggestions or changes to the dependency by submitting a pull request. (Please do—I’m busy and not very creative at making events!)
